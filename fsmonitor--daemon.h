/*
 * Pathname classifications.
 *
 * The daemon classifies the pathnames that it receives from file
 * system notification events into the following categories and uses
 * that to decide whether clients are told about them.  (And to watch
 * for file system synchronization events.)
 *
 * The client should only care about paths within the working
 * directory proper (inside the working directory and not ".git" nor
 * inside of ".git/").  That is, the client has read the index and is
 * asking for a list of any paths in the working directory that have
 * been modified since the last token.  The client does not care about
 * file system changes within the .git directory (such as new loose
 * objects or packfiles).  So the client will only receive paths that
 * are classified as IS_WORKDIR_PATH.
 *
 * The daemon uses the IS_DOT_GIT and IS_GITDIR internally to mean the
 * exact ".git" directory or GITDIR.  If the daemon receives a delete
 * event for either of these directories, it will automatically
 * shutdown, for example.
 *
 * Note that the daemon DOES NOT explicitly watch nor special case the
 * ".git/index" file.  The daemon does not read the index and does not
 * have any internal index-relative state.  The daemon only collects
 * the set of modified paths within the working directory.
